To handle large rust projects we make use of cargo:

Following are the most useful cargo commands:
a) We can make a new rust project using : $ cargo new <project-name>
b) We can build the project using : $ cargo build 
c) We can direclty build and run the project using: $ cargo run 
d) We can check if the rust project works or not without having to build the executable:
$ cargo check
e) We build rust projects using '.toml' configuration files.

Cargo as convention:
$ git clone www.example.com
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build 

To install the latest stable version of rust using 'rustup'. 

The basic structure of generated Cargo.toml :
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
